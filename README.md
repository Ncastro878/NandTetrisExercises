# NandTetrisExercises - Part 1.
These are my assigments/code from the NandTetris course on Coursera which I audited.

That means none of my work was graded, but it was a good learning experience and all code/assignments done on my own seem to have
fulfilled the requirements/objective of the projects/assignment/learning-goals.
What could certainly use work is optimization of code, but for the first go-round I was happy with getting the proper results 
and functionality of my code. 

I may also include tips and notes taken for future-Me for finishing assignments/projects.
